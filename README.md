# Helmet Game

## Purpose

This project is a JavaScript videogame I made by the request of a therapy centre for children with special needs

## Details

The game runs by hosting it in its entirety and loading the index.html file. 
Although, there are many unused assets in this version, due to some game features being cut down after a couple iterations.
